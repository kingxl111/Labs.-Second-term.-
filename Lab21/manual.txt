merge_script is a program for combining files
that have a smaller size compared to the source file, as well
as a specific suffix that can be obtained as a parameter
when running the script, or specified in the configuration file. The same applies
to the source file.

By default, the program compares the size of the file
that follows the keys directly, or, if there are no keys, the size of the very first file.

The suffix is followed by the input file being compared.
In the case when the parameters are read from the configuration file,
the keys are followed by a non-empty sequence of files that need to be combined into one.
The configuration file contains the suffix and the absolute path to the file to
be compared.

As parameters , it can take:
1) The path to the file being compared

2) Files to be merged

3) The key -o, which allows you to write the result of the script to a file.
By default, the result is output to the standard output stream, to the console.

4) The help key, which outputs information about the use of the script to the standard output stream

5) The key is l, which at the end of the concatenation outputs the number of lines in the final file

6) The key is c, which symbolizes that the program will read the parameters from the configuration file

Command format:

cmd --help

cmd -l -s "suffix" compare_file file1 ... file?* -o new file name

cmd -l -c file1 ... file?* -o new file_name

cmd --help
